**Project Description**

SQL Editor is a fully-featured, desktop SQL IDE built with Python, Tkinter, and ttkbootstrap.
It delivers a modern, lightweight alternative to heavy database clients by combining an intuitive UI with powerful tooling for writing, debugging, visualizing, and exploring SQL data.

The application connects to MySQL databases and offers multi-tab editing, auto-complete, result pagination, AI-assisted SQL generation, interactive schema diagrams, data visualizations, and system-level database tools — all inside a polished interface.
